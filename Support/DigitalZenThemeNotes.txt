	CustomLogo
		Install
			The custom logo support should be added first to your theme using add_theme_support(), and then be called in your theme using the_custom_logo()

			To enable the use of a custom logo in your theme, add the following to your functions.php file:
				add_theme_support( 'custom-logo' );
				function themename_custom_logo_setup() {
				 $defaults = array(
				 'height'      => 100,
				 'width'       => 400,
				 'flex-height' => true,
				 'flex-width'  => true,
				 'header-text' => array( 'site-title', 'site-description' ),
				 );
				 add_theme_support( 'custom-logo', $defaults );
				}
				add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'themename_custom_logo_setup' );
		Display
		$custom_logo_id = get_theme_mod( 'custom_logo' );
		$image = wp_get_attachment_image_src( $custom_logo_id , 'full' );
		echo $image[0];

		if ( function_exists( 'the_custom_logo' ) ) {
		 the_custom_logo();
		}
